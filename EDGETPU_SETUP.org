#+AUTHOR: Aidan Pace
#+DATE: [2025-03-19 Wed]

* Environment Information
- Platform: Raspberry Pi 4
- Operating System: Debian bookworm (Raspberry Pi OS)
- Python version: 3.9.18 (using Poetry virtual environment)
- Project location: =/home/aygp-dr/opt/project-keyword-spotter=

* Current Status
Our diagnostic script =check_edgetpu_status.py= detected the following issues:

** TensorFlow Lite Runtime Version Mismatch
- Current version: 2.14.0
- Recommended version for Edge TPU: 2.5.0.post1
- This may cause compatibility issues with the Edge TPU models

** Coral USB Device Not Detected
- The script could not find a Coral USB Accelerator connected to the system
- This is required for EdgeTPU acceleration

** Project Structure
- Basic Poetry project structure is in place
- Poetry configuration has been updated with proper dependencies

* Action Items
** TensorFlow Lite Runtime Downgrade
#+begin_src bash
pip install https://github.com/google-coral/pycoral/releases/download/v2.0.0/tflite_runtime-2.5.0.post1-cp39-cp39-linux_aarch64.whl
#+end_src

** Verify Coral USB Connection
- Check physical connection
- Run =lsusb= to verify device is recognized
- Verify proper permissions

** Update Poetry Environment
#+begin_src bash
poetry install
#+end_src

* Completed Tasks
** Remote Repository Changed
- Changed remote from Google Coral to your fork: =https://github.com/aygp-dr/project-keyword-spotter.git=
- Added jwalsh as collaborator to the repository

** Poetry Configuration Updated
- Updated pyproject.toml with proper Poetry format
- Added required dependencies with specific versions compatible with Edge TPU

** Project Structure Created
- Added =project_keyword_spotter= package directory
- Created diagnostic script for checking Edge TPU setup

* Edge TPU Library Status
- Edge TPU library is properly installed at =/usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/libedgetpu.so.1=
- Python environment is compatible (3.9.18)

* Next Steps
1. Downgrade TensorFlow Lite Runtime to version 2.5.0.post1
2. Connect and verify Coral USB Accelerator
3. Run the model with =python3 run_model.py= to test complete setup
